## Presets Manager

![Image](../../../images/presets_manager.png)

Presets Manager is an interface for managing and using profiles. It is based on two types of lists: the list of presets, 
selectable by a drop down, and the list of profiles that always remains on display. Each preset can contain one or more 
profiles; each profile can be executed as a conversion process; it can be edited or deleted. A user can also create new 
profiles and organize them on certain presets.

New profiles can also be added by 'Video Conversions' and 'Audio Conversions' interfaces. Every time you set a specific
configuration of the conversion parameters and press the 'Save As Profile' button, you will save those parameters in the 
'User Profile' preset of the 'Presets Manager' interface.
