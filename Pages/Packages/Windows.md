A lot of antivirus vendors detect Videomass.exe as malicious. Since
these are false positives, the only thing to do is to submit the
Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced analysis
and making a False Positive claim.

For any other application-related issues, please read 
[Known Problems](../../known_problems) and [Bug Reports](../Bugs) pages.
