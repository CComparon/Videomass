## Important note
{: .bg-red-300}

A lot of antivirus vendors detect Videomass.exe as malicious. Since
these are false positives, to resolve this problem the only thing to do is 
to submit the Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced analysis
and making a False Positive claim. 
So, if you are still worried (or worse, scared) by the alarm cry of an overly 
susceptible array of antivirus, you can always install [Python](https://www.python.org/), 
then open a console in user mode and install Videomass: `py -m pip install videomass` .   
You will have the exact same program but installed in a more Pythonic way and 
certainly free from false positives.

page for more installation [details](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installing-dependencies).

[Known Problems](../../known_problems) and [Bug Reports](../Bugs) pages.
