### Important note
{: .bg-red-300}

A lot of antivirus vendors detect Videomass **installer** and **portable** as 
malicious. Since these are false positives, to resolve this problem the only thing 
to do is to submit the Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced 
analysis and making a False Positive claim. 
So, if you are still worried (or worse, scared) by the alarm cry of an overly 
susceptible array of antivirus, you can always try the new 
[Pyembed package](#pyembed-package) or install Videomass from 
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/videomass/). You will have the exact same program 
but installed in a more Pythonic way and certainly free from false positives.   
Visit the 
[Installing-dependencies](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installing-dependencies#ms-windows) 
and then 
[installation using pip](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installation-using-pip) 
wiki pages for more installation details.

This is a fully portable and ready-to-use experimental implementation of the 
[Python embeddable package](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package), 
which has been optimized to include Videomass and its dependencies. 
An embeddable-package is a portable Python distribution completely isolated from 
the userâ€™s system, including environment variables, system registry settings, and 
installed packages.
