### Important note
{: .bg-red-300}

A lot of antivirus vendors detect **Videomass installer** and **Videomass portable edition** 
as malicious. Since these are false positives, to resolve this problem the only thing 
to do is to submit the Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced 
analysis and making a False Positive claim. 

So, if you are still worried (or worse, scared) by the alarm cry of an overly 
susceptible array of antivirus, you can always try the following method: 

* [PyPi package](Python_Package) 

For any other application-related issues, please read 
[Known Problems](../../known_problems) and [Bug Reports](../Bugs) pages.
