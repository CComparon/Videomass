## Windows and MacOs Users

Using the appropriate installers, Windows and MacOs users will be accompanied by a wizard to determine the existence 
and the path of FFmpeg. Usually FFmpeg is included with the installers and it will not be a big problem if FFmpeg is 
not installed on your system.

## Linux Users
Linux users will see the program start normally. As often repeated, Videomass2 will not work without the FFmpeg backend, 
so FFmpeg is a dependency that can not be omitted and therefore also Python2.7 and wxPython3.0. For now Videomass2 will 
not automatically satisfy these dependencies and you will have to provide for yourself.

## All

During the first start-up, the application provides a drag n drop interface in which it is possible to load several files 
at a time. Once you have dragged at least one file, the **Presets Manager**, **Video Conversions** and **Audio Conversions** buttons on the main toolbar are enabled. You can choose a specific export path or export to the same source path. 
The **clear** button will delete the entire contents of the loaded list. A contextual menu is available that can be activated 
with a double click or with the right mouse button to reproduce or view metadata of each selected media.
