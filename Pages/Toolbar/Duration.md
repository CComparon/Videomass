## Duration

When any time is set, the Duration button in the secondary toolbar is turned with a green gradient. 
When all time values are reset with the Clear key and then confirmed, the key color will return to default.

The Duration tool consists of two different parameters: 
**Seeking** (time position) and **Cut** (duration) both expressed in hours, minutes and seconds (hh,mm,ss).
Note that on Videomass2 the Cut parameter (duration) always refers to the total duration from the set Seeking 
point (if set), and not from the beginning of the first scene of a movie.

If you need to extract only a specific part of your media file, you will need to use the Seeking parameter to get 
a specific part of the time position.
To extract only a small segment in the middle of a film, it can be used in conjunction with Cut, which specifies the 
duration.

**Tip:** To find out the overall duration of an imported media file, you can use the Show Metadata tool.

**trick:** To perform conversion tests, you can use the ** Cut ** parameter to set a short duration without 
waiting for the end of a whole process (which can sometimes be very long).

**NOTES:** On Videomass2 the Duration tool, when set, generates a parameter that is reflected globally throughout 
the program and in all those processes that use it, ie in all conversion processes with presets, video conversions, 
audio conversions and playback.
Keeping this principle in mind you can enable or disable this tool as needed.
