## Show Metadata

![Image](../../images/metadata_window.png)    

Show Metadata is the tool for viewing all the information contained in each imported and selected media file in 
an orderly manner. You can also run multiple open instances on different media files, for example to make various 
data comparisons.   

It can be opened either from the context menu in the drag n drop interface, or from the Show Metadata button located on the secondary toolbar.
