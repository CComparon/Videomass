### Notice:

From 1.6.1 version, Videomass is compatible only with Python3 and therefore 
with wxPython4 (phoenix). For some reasons, such as the end of Python2 
support by 1 January 2020, the technical difficulties in the practical 
management of the code of both Python versions and the time investments 
for porting, Videomass will cease development for compatibility on 
Python2 .
