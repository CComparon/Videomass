DESCRIPTION:
    
These files are useful for replacing all * .py on vdms_PROCESS when creating a 
Videomass.exe with current setup.py and py2exe. It differs only for some lines 
of code added to subprocess.popen, necessary to prevent the dos window from 
appearing during processes with Videomass.exe package only.
