![Image](/images/videomass.png)

Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for medium advanced users who
need to store profiles and automate some conversion processes, but which
can also be used by beginner users through the use of ready-to-use presets.
It features graphic tools with high automation capabilities such as PEAK,
RMS and EBU audio normalization filters with selectable audio stream indexing,
streams analyzer and more.

It allows you to create new presets or import/export existing ones, write and
edit new conversion profiles in order to use [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
without limits of formats, codecs and commands.

In fact, most of the operations performed with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
via the command line, can be stored as conversion profiles on Videomass and can
be performed or modified on the fly.

Videomass also offers a graphical interface for the famous video downloader
[youtube_dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) and allows you to choose
between various download options like a specific format codes with the ability
to playback individual URLs with different qualities via mpv player. Allows also
to download all playlist, embed thumbnail in audio file (via atomicparsley),
add metadata to file and write subtitles to video.
