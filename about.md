## What is Videomass2?

Videomass2 is a desktop multimedia conversion application completely based on FFmpeg, able to convert movies, music and images, but above all to have a high flexibility and expandability in the management and control of presets and storage profiles. Originally created for the purpose of being usable on most platforms while maintaining the same touch and feel of each operating system. That's why it was written in Python with the most popular toolkit ever: wxPython.   

Videomass2 is a project created by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack)
