Videomass is a desktop multimedia conversion application completely based on 
FFmpeg, able to convert audio and video in many different formats. It is 
multi-platform and work on Linux, Unix, MacOs and Windows with same native look 
and feel of each operating system.   

From the beginning, the main goal was to give it a high flexibility and 
expandability in the management and control of the profiles sorted in a list 
of predefined presets, in order to facilitate their use with the potential 
of FFmpeg.   

Videomass is a project created by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack) and it was
written in Python3 with the wxPython4 "Phoenix" .
