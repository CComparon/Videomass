## What is Videomass?
![Image](/images/videomass.png)

Videomass is not a converter; it provides a graphical interface for writing presets 
and profiles to be used with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) without limits on 
formats and codecs; it also provides graphical interface for 
[youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) with useful functions for 
downloading video and audio content from [YouTube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) 
and few more sites.    

From the beginning, the main goal was to give it a high flexibility and 
expandability in the management and control of the presets and profiles in order 
to facilitate their use with the potential of FFmpeg.

Videomass is a project created by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack) and it was
written in Python3 with the wxPython4 "Phoenix", then it is cross-platform and 
work on Linux, Mac-Os, MS-Windows and FreeBSD.    

## What is FFmpeg?

complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. 
It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library."* FFmpeg is a

## What is [youtube_dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)?

few more sites. It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+,
