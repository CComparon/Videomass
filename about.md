# What is Videomass?

---

Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
enthusiasts who need to manage custom profiles to automate conversion/transcoding 
processes.   

It is based on an advanced use of presets and profiles in order to use most of 
the [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) commands without limits of formats and 
codecs.   

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia 
streams and downloading videos via youtube-dl.  

Videomass is a project created and maintained by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack) 
and it was written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/) with the 
[wxPython4 "Phoenix"](https://www.wxpython.org/) toolkit, then it is cross-platform 
and works on Linux, MacOs, Windows and FreeBSD.   

Videomass Logo and related artworks are created by Gianluca Pernigotto 
(jeanslack) and by [KDE/Breeze Icons](https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons).

## What is youtube-dl?

[youtube_dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) is a command-line program to
download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites 
(actually, the list is [long](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)). 
It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not 
platform specific. It should work on your Unix box, on Windows or on macOS. It 
is released to the public domain, which means you can modify it, redistribute 
it or use it however you like.
