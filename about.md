## What is Videomass?
![Image](/images/videomass.png)

Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed especially for medium and advanced 
users who need to write and store profiles to automate some conversion processes 
via [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). It also has some ready-to-use presets that 
make it easy for inexperienced command line users.

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia 
streams such as PEAK, RMS and EBU-R128 audio normalization filters with selectable 
audio stream indexing, streams analyzer, video downloading and more. 

It allows you to create, import or export presets, write new conversion profiles, 
save changes to existing ones or edit them on the fly without making changes, in 
order to use [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) without limits of formats, codecs 
and commands.

Videomass is a project created by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack) and it was
written in Python3 with the wxPython4 "Phoenix", then it is cross-platform and
work on Linux, Mac-Os, MS-Windows and FreeBSD.
