## What is Videomass?

Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
enthusiasts who need to manage custom profiles to automate conversion/transcoding 
processes.   

It is based on an advanced use of presets and profiles in order to use most of 
the [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) commands without limits of formats and 
codecs.   

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia 
streams and downloading videos via youtube-dl.  

Videomass is a project created by Gianluca Pernigotto (jeanslack) and it was
written in Python3 with the wxPython4 "Phoenix", then it is cross-platform and
works on Linux, Mac-Os, MS-Windows and FreeBSD.
