## Build a redistributable package
### Installing required dependencies on your OS
-----------------
#### Windows:
1. Download the latest release of the Python2.7 for your architecture from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
   install it.
   For your convenience, I strongly recommend that you install for all users and check all the options offered by the
   installer.     
  
2. Download the latest release of wxPython3.0 toolkit for python 2.7 compatible with your system architecture from [souceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/) and install it for all users and check all the options offered by the installer.   

3. Download the Videomass2 TAR or ZIP sources at the top of this page and extract the archive.   

4. Download the static version of FFmpeg binaries for your system architecture from <https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/>, then extract the archive. Inside the *bin* folder you will find the FFmpeg's executables: ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe and ffplay.exe (the extensions depends to your system settings or preferences). Now, you can copy and paste all the 'bin' folder to '\Videomass2\Win32Setup\FFMPEG_BIN', or you can set the path later on Videomass2.   


#### MacOs:
On MaOS, there is no need to install python since it should already be installed by default. For the rest, the most convenient way to get all dependencies is to use the [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tool. However, homebrew uses the "Command Line Tools" installed on your machine. By default, OS X does not ship with this tool, and you need to manually install it. One way to install it is to install Xcode, and it will install these commands as well. But, Xcode is heavy (in filesize), and unless you are a developer, you wonâ€™t have any need for it. Well, you can do it by just installing the command line tools only:
```
xcode-select --install  
```
When this is finished, you can install homebrew!
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
After installing 'homebrew' you can immediately proceed to install wxPython and FFmpeg.
```
$ brew install wxpython
```
There are different ways to get FFmpeg, we consider only two here.   

1. By homebrew (the simply and secure way)   

   Before installing FFmpeg you could take a look at this interesting explanation of its homebrew compilation options:   
   <https://gist.github.com/clayton/6196167>   

   Or search for the options you want to enable on homebrew:   
   <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg>    

   Otherwise, get this command for enable all options:   
   ```
   brew install ffmpeg --with-chromaprint --with-fdk-aac --with-fontconfig --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-game-music-emu --with-libass --with-libbluray --with-libbs2b --with-libcaca --with-libgsm --with-libmodplug --with-librsvg --with-libsoxr --with-libssh --with-libvidstab --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openh264 --with-openjpeg --with-openssl --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-rubberband --with-sdl2 --with-snappy --with-speex --with-tesseract --with-theora --with-tools --with-two-lame --with-wavpack --with-webp --with-x265 --with-xz --with-zeromq --with-zimg
   ```
2. By download the precompiled static binary files:   

   Go at this page <https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/macos64/static/>, download your prefered file, then extract the archive.
   Inside the 'bin' folder you find the ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay binaries already to use with the terminal app or by Videomass2.
   Now, you can copy and paste all the 'bin' folder to '/Videomass2/MAcOsxSetup/FFMPEG_BIN/', or you can set the path later on Videomass2. 

#### Gnu/Linux:
As MacOS,  there is no need to install python since it should already be installed by default. Proceede with installing wxPython and FFmpeg if not already installed. On Debian and Ubuntu based distribuitions, install required dependencies with super user (su) or super user do (sudo):

```
~# apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0 ffmpeg
```
