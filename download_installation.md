# Downloads and installation
---


Choose your operating system below and follow the instructions to 
download, install or run the executable. All binaries can be found on the 
[Releases](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/releases) page.   

Note, Videomass is also hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/videomass/), 
but it needs the Python interpreter to work. For more information visit the 
[wiki page](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installing-from-PyPi-with-pip-command).
