Videomass is available for the major PC operating systems, and 
is also hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/videomass/), but it needs the 
Python interpreter to work.   
For more information visit the [Installing from PyPi with pip command](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installing-from-PyPi-with-pip-command) 
wiki page.

Alternatively, choose your operating system below and follow the instructions to 
download, install or run the executable.
