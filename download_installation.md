## Windows and MacOS installers:
Installers are available at the top of this page. 
They are only available for x86_64 (64-bit) architecture. Both installers contain 
everything you need to be used in standalone mode, without the need for anything else.

Minimum requirements are:
- MacOS High Sierra (64-bit only)
- Microsoft Windows 7 to Windows 10 (64-bit only)

## Windows, MacOs, Unix, Linux:
Also, wheels are available for all systems and architectures from 
[Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/videomass/) that can be 
installed using the **pip** command. Please, see the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Installing-from-PyPi) page 
for explanations.
