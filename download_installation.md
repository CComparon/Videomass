# Download and installation
--------------

### Ubuntu PPA
This PPA currently publishes packages for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal (for now)

    `$ sudo apt-get update`   
    `$ sudo apt install python3-videomass`   

### AppImage
There is also a Videomass AppImage package, which supports some Linux flavors.
Visit the latest Videomass releases at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/videomass2/files/) 
page for more details.

### Windows and MacOS installers
In addition, installers for Windows and MacOS are available at the top of this page 
(for some functional limitations see [Known Problems](https://jeanslack.github.io/Videomass/known_problems.html)). 
They are only available for x86_64 (64-bit) architectures. 
Both installers contain everything you need to be used in standalone mode, without 
the need for anything else.

Minimum requirements are:
- MacOS **Sierra**, **High Sierra** and **Mojave** (64-bit only)
- Microsoft **Windows 7** to **Windows 10** (64-bit only)
