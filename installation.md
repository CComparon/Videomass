They are only available for x86_64 (64-bit) architecture. Both installers contain 
everything you need to be used in standalone mode, without the need for anything else.

Minimum requirements are:
- MacOS High Sierra (64-bit only)

PyPi (Python Package Index) at <https://pypi.org/project/videomass2/> that you 
can install it by **pip** command.
First you must have Python2.7 and wxPython3.0 already installed in your 
system, of course. Then you have to make sure you also have pip installed, 
if not, install it: <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/>.
