# Installation
--------------
## Windows and MacOS installers:
Installers are available at the top of this page. 
They are only available for x86_64 (64-bit) architecture. Both installers contain 
everything you need to be used in standalone mode, without the need for anything else.

Minimum requirements are:
- MacOS High Sierra (64-bit only)
- Microsoft Windows 7 to Windows 10 (64-bit only)

## Windows, MacOs, Unix, Linux:
Also, for all systems and architectures there is available the wheel on 
[PyPi (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/videomass/) that you 
can install it via **pip** command.
First you must have [these dependencies](dependencies.md) already 
installed in your system, of course. Then you have to make sure you also have 
**pip** installed, if not, install it: <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/>.
