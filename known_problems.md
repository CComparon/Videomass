- On windows, with the version of FFmpeg 3.1.5 included in the installer, the **nlmeans** filter is not implemented, 
as it exists only in the most recent versions of FFmpeg. Use **hqdn3d** instead.

- Non-ASCII and UTF8 characters are not yet supported on Videomass2. Before importing files with non-ASCII/UTF8 names, 
please rename them appropriately.
