## Known problems and solutions of Videomass

- On Windows, with the version 3.1.5 of FFmpeg included in the installation program, 
the denoiser _nlmeans_ filter is not implemented, since it exists only in the most 
recent versions of FFmpeg. Use _hqdn3d_ instead or set Videomass to a path with a 
newer version of FFmpeg.
