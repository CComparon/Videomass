- On windows, with the version of FFmpeg 3.1.5 included in the installer, the **nlmeans** denoiser filter is not implemented, 
as it exists only in the most recent versions of FFmpeg. Use **hqdn3d** instead, or set Videomass2 to a path with a newer version of FFmpeg.

- Non-ASCII and UTF8 characters are not yet supported on Videomass2. Before importing files with non-ASCII/UTF8 names, 
please rename them appropriately. This problem affects all platforms (Windows, MacOsx and Linux).

- On MacOsx when there are problems related to the Videomass2 configuration folder, or when the configuration file version 
changes, the warning dialogs disappear immediately. One solution is to permanently delete the configuration folder and 
re-open the Videomass2 program.
