NOTE TO TRASLATORS:

To start a new translation, create two new folders (for example 'de_DE' for 
the German language and 'LC_MESSAGES') with the following example tree:

    /locale
        /de_DE
            /LC_MESSAGES
            
Copy the file translation template with the ".pot" extension, located in 
the source '/local' folder, and paste into the 'LC_MESSAGES' folder, 
renaming the extension to ".po". 
Now you can work on your new native language tanslation with a translation 
editing program, for example 'poedit', and then save it by generating a 
'.mo' file.

Than update the "videomass2/vdms_SYS/app_const.py" file by adding the newly 
translated language to the dictionary, for example add this line:

    u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
    
to:

    supLang = {u "en": wx.LANGUAGE_ENGLISH,
               u "it": wx.LANGUAGE_ITALIAN,
               u "de": wx.LANGUAGE_GERMAN,
               }
