# How to update new presets versions
--------------
From version 3.3.5, Videomass can manage the import and export of presets more 
efficiently. Furthermore, the possibility of checking the presence of new 
versions of the presets and also of downloading them has been implemented. 

To use new presets, follow the steps below.

## By Videomass Application

- Launch the Videomass application.
- Check if there are new versions on the menu bar > tools, then click on "Check for new presets" .
- If there are new versions, go to the menu bar > tools, then click on "Download the latest presets" .
- Open the folder where you chose to download the presets, then extract the tarball.
- From the Videomass Home panel click on the big Presets Manager button and drag some audio/video files (one is enough).
- Click the Next button on the toolbar to switch on Presets Manager panel.
- On the left side of the Presets box, click on the "Import preset" button or the "Import group" button and follow the instructions that appear.
- The new presets should appear in the drop-down menu.

## Downloading from the development page

- Go to [Videomass-presets page](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass-presets)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass-presets/releases) available
- Extract tarball or zipball archive.
- From the Videomass Home panel click on the big Presets Manager button and drag some audio/video files (one is enough).
- Click the Next button on the toolbar to switch on Presets Manager panel.
- On the left side of the Presets box, click on the "Import preset" button or the "Import group" button and follow the instructions that appear.
- The new presets should appear in the drop-down menu.

**WARNING**: If you confirm to update Videomass presets, all presets with the 
same name will be overwritten. If you have saved new profiles and do not want 
to lose them, it is strongly recommended to make a backup of the old version of 
your presets and then reintegrate your profiles on the new version of the presets.
To do this

- Go to the Presets Manager panel and click on the "Export all..." button.
- import the new presets and confirm.
- With a text editor, open each presets where you have stored your profiles.
- In the profiles section of the the Presets Manager panel, click on the "Add" 
button and create a new profile by copying the same entries you find in the text 
editor, then save it.
