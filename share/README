=======================
NOTE FOR share/videomass folder configuration:
=======================

Update: October 14 2019
-----------------------

This directory contains the Videomass configuration files.
Furthermore, it is used to store log files during conversion 
processes and to load '.vdms' presets localized on /vdms folder.

videomass.conf and videomassWin32.conf (for MS Windows) are the main 
Videomass configuration files and are also used for storing user preferences.

When you run the program for the first time, the contents of this folder are 
copied to the default location of the videomass configuration directory, 
according to the conventions typical of each operating system:

        On *nix OS's:   '~/.config/videomass'
        On MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        On Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT
--------------
Files with ".vdms" format are simple text files with JSON
data structure. Since version 1.7.5 Videomass uses JSON data 
for its presets while old ones with xml data are now obsolete 
and incompatible. This allowed some advantages in the presets 
management and some savings in system resources.


To create new Videomass compatible file presets follow these general 
guidelines:

[
    {
        "Name": "",
        "Description": "",
        "First_pass": "",
        "Second_pass": "",
        "Supported_list": "",
        "Output_extension": ""
    }
]

The JSON object above is a representation of an empty profile.
The following use may be more useful:

[
    { 
        "Name": "From Video to WAV",
        "Description":  "Extracting WAV audio stream from video",
        "First_pass": "-vn -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 2 -ar 44100 ",
        "Second_pass": "",
        "Supported_list": "",
        "Output_extension": "wav"
    },

    { 
        "Name": "From Video to WMA",
        "Description":  "Extracting VMA audio stream from video",
        "First_pass": "-vn -acodec wmav2 -b:a 160k -ac 2 -ar 44100 ",
        "Second_pass": "",
        "Supported_list": "",
        "Output_extension": "wma"
    }
]
