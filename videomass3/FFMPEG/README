========================================
Purpose of the FFMPEG directory
========================================

Optionally this folder can contain the static builds of ffmpeg, ffprobe and 
ffplay. This may only be useful for creating e.g. a Videomass bundle that 
can be run in standalone mode also including FFmpeg (without need to install 
anything else).
If you want to use this approach, be sure to create or copy the `bin/` directory 
and its content included in the static builds, like this:

    FFMPEG
    |__ bin
    |   |__ ffmpeg
    |   |__ ffprobe
    |   |__ ffplay
    |__ presets 
    |__ doc 
    |__ LICENSE.txt
    |__ README.txt

=======================================
MAcOS
=======================================

The static builds for MacOS with Intel 64bit can be downloaded at:
    
    - http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/
or
    - https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
    
If you don't want to use statically compiled builds, leave this folder empty. 
You can later use Homebrew to install FFmpeg. Building options and steps can be 
found here:

=============================================================================
For legal reasons (for example: including FAAC for AAC support) it is illegal
to distribute the FFmpeg binary compiled in some countries of the world, for example,
with the FAAC codec for AAC support. The distributable binary of FFmpeg does not
include faac support, which, however, can be obtained from compiling the source code.
If you need the faac codec (or other codecs with special restrictions) in FFmpeg, you
should compile yourself from the source with the faac codec support.
